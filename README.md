## Requirement
- [The Knot Layout Gem](http://git.xogrp.com/design/the_knot_layout)

Thanks to Enrico Teotti for getting the GPT Ad library integrated in the Knot Layout Gem and the [Pattern Library](http://patterns.xogrp.com) Team for their work on [Ad containers](http://patterns.xogrp.com/ad_containers.html).




## Asynchronous Ad calls

```html
<script>
XO.ads.gpt.addAsyncSlot({
	idSelector: "ad",
	sizes: [300,250],
	targeting: [  
	["pos",1]
	]
});
</script>
```

## Synchronous Ad calls

```html
<script>
XO.ads.gpt.addAsyncSlot({
  idSelector: "ad",
  sync: true,
  sizes: [300,250],
  targeting: [  
  ["pos",1]
  ]
});
</script>
```

## Ad slot refresh and targeting refresh
- This method performs an in-page ad refresh.  The 1st required parameter expects a number from 1 .. n where n is the nth ad call.  The 2nd required parameter expects an array of key/value pairs where the 1st array value is a key and the 2nd array value is either an integer or string.

```
<script>
XO.ads.gpt.refreshAdSlot(1,["pos",1]);
</script>
```


## Interchangeable ad calls
- One ad call will show either a fixed size ad or Native Ad


### New Interchangeable Ad Call
- This ad call will return a fixed 300x250 ad or a native ad.  The [1,1] represents the Native ad card

```
<script>
XO.ads.gpt.addAsyncSlot({
	idSelector: "ad",
	sizes: [ [300,250], [1,1] ],	//[1,1] represents the Native ad card	
	targeting: [  
	["pos",1],
	]
});
</script>
```


### Full Leaderboard Ad Call (For Pattern Library)
- This ad call will return 728x90, 970x90, 970x66, 970x67 (pushdown), 970x68 (super pushdown), 970x91 (super pushdown) ads

```
<script>
XO.ads.gpt.addAsyncSlot({
    idSelector: "ad",
    sizes: [ [728,90], [970,90], [970,91], [970,66], [970,67], [970,68] ],   
    targeting: [  
	    ["pos", "728top"],
    ]
});
</script>
```

## Google Publisher Console
You can use an on-screen debugging tool called the Google Publisher Console to troubleshoot delivery problems. The console checks your page for many common JavaScript tagging errors, identifies all of the ad units and creatives on the page, and helps you visualize the ad request behavior of a web page.

To enable the Publisher Console on a page tagged with the Google Publisher Tag:

Append ?google_force_console or ?googfc to your page's URL.

For example, if your page is located at www.google.com/gpt, youâ€™d modify the URL to www.google.com/gpt?google_force_console or www.google.com/gpt?googfc.
