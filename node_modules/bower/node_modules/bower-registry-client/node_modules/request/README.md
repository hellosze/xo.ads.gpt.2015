# Request -- Simplified HTTP client

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/request.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/request/)

## Super simple to use

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

```javascript
var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.
  }
})
```

## Streaming

You can stream any response to a file stream.

```javascript
request('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

You can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.

```javascript
fs.createReadStream('file.json').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/obj.js
